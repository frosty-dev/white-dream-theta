changes: 
  - balance: "See the below, optimal power setups may have changed, try out those 100% plasma hell setups of yours, it should actually give you a power benefit now. Oh and Pluoxium should be a bit more of a safety gas now."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the SM not increasing/decreasing rad output with most gasses."
